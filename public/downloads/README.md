# PDF Download Setup Instructions

## Setup Complete!

The infrastructure for PDF download functionality has been created. Here's what you need to do:

### 1. Add Your PDF File

Place your investor deck PDF file in the following location:

```
public/downloads/investors-deck.pdf
```

### 2. File Structure Created

- ✅ `/public/downloads/` - Directory for storing PDF files
- ✅ `/src/app/api/download-deck/route.ts` - API endpoint for zip downloads
- ✅ `/src/components/ui/download-deck-button.tsx` - Download button component
- ✅ Updated deck pages with download button overlay

### 3. Dependencies Added

- ✅ `jszip` - For creating zip files
- ✅ `@types/jszip` - TypeScript types

### 4. How It Works

1. User clicks "Download Investors Deck" button on `/deck` page
2. API route (`/api/download-deck`) creates a zip file containing:
   - Your PDF file (renamed to `Cabo_Negro_Investors_Deck.pdf`)
   - A README.txt file with project information
3. Browser downloads the zip file automatically

### 5. Features

- ✅ Loading state with spinner during download
- ✅ Error handling with user feedback
- ✅ Professional zip file naming
- ✅ Includes README with project details
- ✅ Responsive button styling
- ✅ Positioned as overlay on deck page

### 6. Next Steps

1. Add your PDF file to `public/downloads/investors-deck.pdf`
2. Test the download functionality
3. Customize the README content if needed

The download button will appear in the top-right corner of the deck page as a floating overlay.
