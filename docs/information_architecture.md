## **⚓ 4. Maritime Terminal Project — “The Port of the Southern Wind”**

### **Message:**

> “Cabo Negro Terminal: A private port for public use — designed to serve Chile’s hydrogen economy.”

### **Development Timeline:**

- **2021–2025:** Engineering, environmental & regulatory stages.
- **2026:** Ready-to-build phase.
- **2027–2030:** Construction and operational launch.

### **Key Features:**

- **Dual-phase port construction:**
  - Phase 1: 350m platform + ramp for vessels (calado 4.5m)
  - Phase 2: 350m bridge + 300m pier (depth up to 16m)
- **Protected port** — minimal impact from tides, waves, or currents.
- **Ideal proximity to city** but **no residential interference**.
- **Interoperable with barge/ferry logistics**.

### **Strategic Advantages:**

- Independent environmental impact vs. full hydrogen plants.
- Reduces CAPEX for H₂V companies (they don’t need to build private ports).
- Enables faster project deployment and reduced environmental footprint.

### **Visuals:**

- 3D animation of the port’s evolution over time.
- Depth/bathymetry animation showing access and docking areas.
